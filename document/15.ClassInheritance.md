## 13. Class Inheritance

#### 1. Class

In kotlin, define using `class` keyword.

~~~kotlin
class Invoice {...}
~~~

#### 2. Constructor

In Kotlin, can get Primary Constructor and more than one Secondary Constructor.

__Primary Constructor__ is one of class header.

~~~kotlin
class Person constructor(name: String) {...}
~~~

Can omit 'constructor' keyword If don't have any annotation or visibility modifier. 

~~~kotlin
class Person (name: String) {...} 
~~~

Can `init{}` block in class. It is execute more faster than constructor.

~~~kotlin
class Person (name: String){

    init {
        println("init")
    }

    constructor(name: String, address: String) : this(name) {
        println("cons")
    }
}
~~~

~~~
init
cons
~~~

When use `val` or `var`, the variable being member value in the class.

~~~kotlin
class Person (val name: String){
...
}
~~~

If constructor has annotation or visibility modifier, need constructor keyword.

~~~kotlin
class Person @Inject constructor (val name: String){
...
}
~~~

#### 3. Class member

Class member can include below content.

- Constructor and initializer block.
- Functions
- Properties
- Nested and inner Classes
- Object Declarations

#### 4. Inheritance

Inheritance is for extends function. When Inheritance another class, will got hierarchy structure.

In Kotlin, whole class get `Any` class as common super class.

>> Any class is not java.lang.Object, Any just get equals(), hashCode(), toString().
