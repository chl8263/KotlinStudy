## 14. Class Delegation

Kotlin class may implement an interface by delegating its method and properties to another object that implements that interface.
This provides a way to compose behavior using association rather than inheritance. 

There are two Interface like below code.

~~~kotlin
interface Fly{
    fun fly()
}

interface Walk{
    fun walk()
}
~~~

And `Bird` class implement Fly.

~~~kotlin
class Bird(): Fly{
    override fun fly() {
        println("Bird Fly")
    }
}
~~~

And `Eagle` class implement Fly using class delegate and Walk.
The `Eagle` class just use `Fly` interface implemented method in `Bird` class. 
 
~~~kotlin
class Eagle(fly: Fly): Fly by fly, Walk{
    override fun walk() {
        println("Eagle walk")
    }
}
~~~

When run like this..

~~~kotlin
fun run(){
    Eagle(Bird()).fly()
}
~~~

The result like below.

~~~
Bird Fly
