## 19. Singleton Object

An object is a special kind of class, which can be declared using object keyword.
Object are similar to Singletons(a design pattern) in java.
It also function as the static part of java.
beginners who are switching from java to kotlin can vastly use this feature,
in place if static, or singleton.

~~~kotlin
object CommonUtils {
    var anyname: String ="Hello"
    fun dispMsg(message: String) {
        println(message)    
    }
}
~~~

From any other class, just invoke the variable and functions in this way:

~~~kotlin
CommonUtils.anyname
CommonUtils.dispMsg("like static call")
~~~
